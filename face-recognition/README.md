# Face Detection 

1. Get the Encodings

```python encode_faces.py --dataset dataset --encodings encodings.pickle```

This will get the faces from the dataset directory which contains different subdirectories, and it will save the encodings to encodings.pickle file, which will be required later for face identification.
