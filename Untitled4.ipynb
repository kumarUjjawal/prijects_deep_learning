Formally established in 1475, although it is much older, it is one of the oldest libraries in the world and contains one of the most significant collections of historical texts. It has 75,000 codices from throughout history, as well as 1.1 million printed books, which include some 8,500 incunabula. \\n\\nThe Vatican Library is a research library for history, law, philosophy, science and theology.

He runs away after being made to feel an outcast and links up with an elf who dreams of becoming a dentist and an adventurer seeking silver and gold. \\n\\nAfter ending up on the Island of Misfit Toys and wandering for a while, Rudolph goes on to save his loved ones from the Abominable Snow Monster and guides Santa through a blizzard that threatens to ruin Christmas. \\n\\nIn 2006, the New York Times reported that fans drove for miles to see the Rudolph and Santa Claus puppets at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta. The pair were thought to be the last of the surviving production puppets.

Valentina was very pale, and round her eyes there were dark circles that told of sleeplessness, and as she bowed her head in prayer, her ladies observed that tears were falling on the illuminated Mass-book over which she bent. And now came Fra Domenico from the sacristy in the white chasuble that the Church ordains for the Corpus Christi feast, followed by a page in a clerkly gown of black, and the Mass commenced. \\n\\nThere were absent only from the gathering Gonzaga and Fortemani, besides a sentry and the three prisoners. Francesco and his two followers. \\n\\nGonzaga had presented himself to Valentina with the plausible tale that, as the events of which Fanfulla's letter had given them knowledge might lead Gian Maria at any moment to desperate measures, it might be well that he should reinforce the single man-at-arms patrolling the walls. Valentina, little recking now whether the castle held or fell, and still less such trifles as Gonzaga's attendance at Mass, had assented without heeding the import of what he said. \\n\\nAnd so, his face drawn and his body quivering with the excitement of what he was about to do, Gonzaga had repaired to the ramparts so soon as he had seen them all safely into chapel. The sentinel was that same clerkly youth Aventano, who had read to the soldiers that letter Gian Maria had sent Gonzaga. This the courtier accepted as a good omen. If a man there was among the soldiery at Roccaleone with whom he deemed that he had an account to settle, that man was Aventano. \", \"questions\": [{\"input_text\": \"Who arrived at the church?\", \"turn_id\": 1}, {\"input_text\": \"Who was followed by a clerk dressed in black?\", \"turn_id\": 2}, {\"input_text\": \"Who was crying?\", \"turn_id\": 3}, {\"input_text\": \"Who noticed it?\", \"turn_id\": 4}, {\"input_text\": \"Did any others arrive with her?\", \"turn_id\": 5}, {\"input_text\": \"What other group of people were in her group?\", \"turn_id\": 6}, {\"input_text\": \"And who in the group was anxious?\", \"turn_id\": 7}, {\"input_text\": \"Was she well-rested?\", \"turn_id\": 8}, {\"input_text\": \"Who should be reinforced?\", \"turn_id\": 9}, {\"input_text\": \"Who thought these measures were required?\", \"turn_id\": 10}], \"answers\": [{\"span_start\": 254, \"span_end\": 297, \"span_text\": \"and the garrison trooped faithfully to Mass\", \"input_text\": \"the garrison first\", \"turn_id\": 1}, {\"span_start\": 687, \"span_end\": 853, \"span_text\": \"And now came Fra Domenico from the sacristy in the white chasuble that the Church ordains for the Corpus Christi feast, followed by a page in a clerkly gown of black,\", \"input_text\": \"Fra.

The story of the reindeer who saves Christmas is beloved among children and adults alike. \\n\\nThe Rankin-Bass animated film production company used Japanese puppets and stop motion to tell the tale, bolstered by a soundtrack featuring Burl Ives' rendition of the theme song. \\n\\nIn the story, Santa's reindeer Donner and his wife have a son, Rudolph, who has the distinction of a nose that glows. He runs away after being made to feel an outcast and links up with an elf who dreams of becoming a dentist and an adventurer seeking silver and gold. \\n\\nAfter ending up on the Island of Misfit Toys and wandering for a while, Rudolph goes on to save his loved ones from the Abominable Snow Monster and guides Santa through a blizzard that threatens to ruin Christmas. \\n\\nIn 2006, the New York Times reported that fans drove for miles to see the Rudolph and Santa Claus puppets at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta. The pair were thought to be the last of the surviving production puppets. They had been taken home by a production company employee and given to her children after filming was completed. \\n\\n\\\"In 2005, the nephew of the original rescuer found the puppets in a family attic and brought them to be appraised on the PBS series 'Antiques Roadshow,' \\\" the Times said. \\\"Created for about $5,000 each in 1964, they were valued at $8,000 to $10,000 for the pair.

The sentinel was that same clerkly youth Aventano, who had read to the soldiers that letter Gian Maria had sent Gonzaga. This the courtier accepted as a good omen.

She wanted him to take charge of her cattle and horse and ranges, and save them if that were possible. Yet, though she could not have spoken aloud all she meant, she was perfectly honest with herself. Whatever the price to be paid, she must keep Lassiter close to her; she must shield from him the man who had led Milly Erne to Cottonwoods. In her fear she so controlled her mind that she did not whisper this Mormon's name to her own soul, she did not even think it. Besides, beyond this thing she regarded as a sacred obligation thrust upon her, was the need of a helper, of a friend, of a champion in this critical time. If she could rule this gun-man, as Venters had called him, if she could even keep him from shedding blood, what strategy to play his flame and his presence against the game of oppression her churchmen were waging against her? Never would she forget the effect on Tull and his men when Venters shouted Lassiter's name. If she could not wholly control Lassiter, then what she could do might put off the fatal day. \\n\\nOne of her safe racers was a dark bay, and she called him Bells because of the way he struck his iron shoes on the stones. When Jerd led out this slender, beautifully built horse Lassiter suddenly became all eyes. A rider's love of a thoroughbred shone in them.

Reindeer\\\" premiered on television December 6, 1964, and is now one of the holiday season's perennial favorites. The story of the reindeer who saves Christmas is beloved among children and adults alike. \\n\\nThe Rankin-Bass animated film production company used Japanese puppets and stop motion to tell the tale, bolstered by a soundtrack featuring Burl Ives' rendition of the theme song. \\n\\nIn the story, Santa's reindeer Donner and his wife have a son, Rudolph, who has the distinction of a nose that glows. He runs away after being made to feel an outcast and links up with an elf who dreams of becoming a dentist and an adventurer seeking silver and gold. \\n\\nAfter ending up on the Island of Misfit Toys and wandering for a while, Rudolph goes on to save his loved ones from the Abominable Snow Monster and guides Santa through a blizzard that threatens to ruin Christmas. \\n\\nIn 2006, the New York Times reported that fans drove for miles to see the Rudolph and Santa Claus puppets at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta. The pair were thought to be the last of the surviving production puppets. They had been taken home by a production company employee and given to her children after filming was completed. \\n\\n\\\"In 2005, the nephew of the original rescuer found the puppets in a family attic and brought them to be appraised on the PBS series 'Antiques Roadshow,' \\\" the Times said. \\\"Created for about $5,000 each in 1964, they were valued at $8,000 to $10,000 for the pair. The family sold both figures to Kevin A. Kriess, the president of TimeandSpaceToys.com and a lifelong fan of the Rankin-Bass films.\\\" \", \"questions\": [{\"input_text\": \"Who is Rudolph's father?\", \"turn_id\": 1}, {\"input_text\": \"Why does Rudolph run away?\", \"turn_id\": 2}, {\"input_text\": \"What makes him different from the other reindeer?\", \"turn_id\": 3}, {\"input_text\": \"Who does he save during a snow storm?\", \"turn_id\": 4}, {\"input_text\": \"Does he save Christmas?\", \"turn_id\": 5}, {\"input_text\": \"What Island does he travel to?\", \"turn_id\": 6}, {\"input_text\": \"Which company produced the movie?\", \"turn_id\": 7}, {\"input_text\": \"When did it premiere?\", \"turn_id\": 8}, {\"input_text\": \"What methods were used in filming the movie?\", \"turn_id\": 9}, {\"input_text\": \"Are all of the puppets still in existence?\", \"turn_id\": 10}, {\"input_text\": \"How many remain?\", \"turn_id\": 11}, {\"input_text\": \"Which?\", \"turn_id\": 12}, {\"input_text\": \"Where had they been stored since their use in the show?\", \"turn_id\": 13}, {\"input_text\": \"When were they rediscovered?\", \"turn_id\": 14}, {\"input_text\": \"When were they put on display?\", \"turn_id\": 15}, {\"input_text\": \"Where?\", \"turn_id\": 16}, {\"input_text\": \"How much did they appraise for in 2005?\", \"turn_id\": 17}, {\"input_text\": \"How much did they originally cost to produce?\", \"turn_id\": 18}, {\"input_text\": \"What year were they made?\", \"turn_id\": 19}, {\"input_text\": \"Who bought them?\", \"turn_id\": 20}], \"answers\": [{\"span_start\": 500, \"span_end\": 557, \"span_text\": \"Santa's reindeer Donner and his wife have a son, Rudolph,\", \"input_text\": \"Donner\", \"turn_id\": 1}, {\"span_start\": 604, \"span_end\": 653, \"span_text\": \"He runs away after being made to feel an outcast \", \"input_text\": \"he felt like an outcast\", \"turn_id\": 2}, {\"span_start\": 548, \"span_end\": 602, \"span_text\": \" Rudolph, who has the distinction of a nose that glows\", \"input_text\": \"his nose glows\", \"turn_id\": 3}, {\"span_start\": 828, \"span_end\": 970, \"span_text\": \"Rudolph goes on to save his loved ones from the Abominable Snow Monster and guides Santa through a blizzard that threatens to ruin Christmas. \", \"input_text\": \"his loved ones\", \"turn_id\": 4}, {\"span_start\": 904, \"span_end\": 970, \"span_text\": \"guides Santa through a blizzard that threatens to ruin Christmas. \", \"input_text\": \"yes\", \"turn_id\": 5}, {\"span_start\": 756, \"span_end\": 800, \"span_text\": \"After ending up on the Island of Misfit Toys\", \"input_text\": \"the Island of Misfit Toys\", \"turn_id\": 6}, {\"span_start\": 303, \"span_end\": 406, \"span_text\": \"The Rankin-Bass animated film production company used Japanese puppets and stop motion to tell the tale\", \"input_text\": \"Rankin-Bass\", \"turn_id\": 7}, {\"span_start\": 76, \"span_end\": 149, \"span_text\": \"\\\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\\" premiered on television December 6, 1964\", \"input_text\": \"December 6, 1964\", \"turn_id\": 8}, {\"span_start\": 303, \"span_end\": 406, \"span_text\": \"The Rankin-Bass animated film production company used Japanese puppets and stop motion to tell the tale\", \"input_text\": \"Japanese puppets and stop motion\", \"turn_id\": 9}, {\"span_start\": 1122, \"span_end\": 1196, \"span_text\": \"The pair were thought to be the last of the surviving production puppets. \", \"input_text\": \"no\", \"turn_id\": 10}, {\"span_start\": 1122, \"span_end\": 1196, \"span_text\": \"The pair were thought to be the last of the surviving production puppets. \", \"input_text\": \"two\", \"turn_id\": 11}, {\"span_start\": 1041, \"span_end\": 1158, \"span_text\": \" the Rudolph and Santa Claus puppets at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta.

THE INTERRUPTED MASS \\n\\nThe morning of that Wednesday of Corpus Christi, fateful to all concerned in this chronicle, dawned misty and grey, and the air was chilled by the wind that blew from the sea. The chapel bell tinkled out its summons, and the garrison trooped faithfully to Mass. \\n\\nPresently came Monna Valentina, followed by her ladies, her pages, and lastly, Peppe, wearing under his thin mask of piety an air of eager anxiety and unrest. Valentina was very pale, and round her eyes there were dark circles that told of sleeplessness, and as she bowed her head in prayer, her ladies observed that tears were falling on the illuminated Mass-book over which she bent. And now came Fra Domenico from the sacristy in the white chasuble that the Church ordains for the Corpus Christi feast, followed by a page in a clerkly gown of black, and the Mass commenced. \\n\\nThere were absent only from the gathering Gonzaga and Fortemani, besides a sentry and the three prisoners. Francesco and his two followers. \\n\\nGonzaga had presented himself to Valentina with the plausible tale that, as the events of which Fanfulla's letter had given them knowledge might lead Gian Maria at any moment to desperate measures, it might be well that he should reinforce the single man-at-arms patrolling the walls. Valentina, little recking now whether the castle held or fell, and still less such trifles as Gonzaga's attendance at Mass, had assented without heeding the import of what he said. \\n\\nAnd so, his face drawn and his body quivering with the excitement of what he was about to do, Gonzaga had repaired to the ramparts so soon as he had seen them all safely into chapel. The sentinel was that same clerkly youth Aventano, who had read to the soldiers that letter Gian Maria had sent Gonzaga. This the courtier accepted as a good omen. If a man there was among the soldiery at Roccaleone with whom he deemed that he had an account to settle, that man was Aventano. \", \"questions\": [{\"input_text\": \"Who arrived at the church?\", \"turn_id\": 1}, {\"input_text\": \"Who was followed by a clerk dressed in black?\", \"turn_id\": 2}, {\"input_text\": \"Who was crying?\", \"turn_id\": 3}, {\"input_text\": \"Who noticed it?\", \"turn_id\": 4}, {\"input_text\": \"Did any others arrive with her?\", \"turn_id\": 5}, {\"input_text\": \"What other group of people were in her group?\", \"turn_id\": 6}, {\"input_text\": \"And who in the group was anxious?\", \"turn_id\": 7}, {\"input_text\": \"Was she well-rested?\", \"turn_id\": 8}, {\"input_text\": \"Who should be reinforced?\", \"turn_id\": 9}, {\"input_text\": \"Who thought these measures were required?\", \"turn_id\": 10}], \"answers\": [{\"span_start\": 254, \"span_end\": 297, \"span_text\": \"and the garrison trooped faithfully to Mass\", \"input_text\": \"the garrison first\", \"turn_id\": 1}, {\"span_start\": 687, \"span_end\": 853, \"span_text\": \"And now came Fra Domenico from the sacristy in the white chasuble that the Church ordains for the Corpus Christi feast, followed by a page in a clerkly gown of black,\", \"input_text\": \"Fra.
